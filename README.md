Project Name: cs4261-programmingAssignment1

Project Description: Our application was built with Android Studio and it allows users to login with a username and password. It secures user information behind this authentication page, so that someone without the correct username and password cannot gain unauthroized access. It also has a button to show registered names from a database. We intend for this button to show registered users from a database to allow users to find their username from the list in case they have forgotten theirs. This is intended for users who want to confirm their identity.
